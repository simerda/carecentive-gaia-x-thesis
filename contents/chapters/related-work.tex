\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

The literature review highlights the substantial potential of deploying Gaia-X or similar initiatives based on federated infrastructures to revolutionize data management, cloud storage, and digital sovereignty in Europe.
Significant investments are driven by the vision of creating a European data economy and reducing dependence on US and Chinese digital service providers.
Additionally, the aim is to ensure compliance with EU regulations and enhance research efforts through data reusability, interoperability, and streamlined data collection using Electronic Health Records (EHRs).

The federated architecture of Gaia-X enables flexible extension of the data infrastructure to meet domain-specific needs and minimizes the risks associated with centralized data silos, which can pose security threats.
Potential use cases for the Gaia-X framework include deployment in European Health Data Spaces (EHDSs), Digital Twins (DTs), and various industries, such as Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). The interoperable federated landscape offers better scalability options, facilitates smooth transitions between providers, prevents vendor lock-in, and improves flexibility compared to monolithic architectures.

Legal considerations primarily involve the protection of personal data, governed mainly by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). In the context of secondary data use for research and development, particularly in healthcare, data reuse is limited by fragmented policies among EU member countries\cite{legal_and_technological_aspects_of_ehds}.
Harmonizing these policies could streamline the data reuse process.

The main risks associated with the Gaia-X initiative include concerns about competitiveness and the potential dilution of digital sovereignty by involving non-EU companies\cite{europe_quest_for_digital_sovereignty}.
Conversely, E.~Celeste\cite{dig_sovereignty_challenges} warns against an excessive push towards digital sovereignty, which could lead to protectionism and be economically counterproductive.
S.~Autolitano and A.~Pawlowska\cite{europe_quest_for_digital_sovereignty} emphasize the need for Gaia-X to address real market needs to avoid the shortcomings of previous projects, such as the French Andromède or the German Bundescloud, and to ensure financial sustainability.
