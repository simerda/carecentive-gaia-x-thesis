\chapter{Results}\label{ch:results}

\begin{chapterabstract}
    This chapter features the results of the experiments that were conducted, which are presented in Chapter~\ref{ch:methods}.
    For clarity, the experiment evaluations are discussed separately in their sections.
    The experiments examine the working state and functionality of the features in the Gaia-X Ecosystem.
\end{chapterabstract}

\section[Participant Compliance]{Obtaining Gaia-X compliance for Participant-related Credentials}\label{sec:obtaining-gaia-x-compliance-for-participant-related-credentials}

\textbf{Result}: \textit{Pass}
\\
\textbf{Comments}: \texttt{LegalRegistrationNumber}, \texttt{TermsAndConditions}, and \texttt{Participant} Gaia-X Credentials were successfully created, and their compliance was obtained.

\section[Service Offering Compliance]{Obtaining Gaia-X compliance for ServiceOffering-related Credentials}\label{sec:obtaining-gaia-x-compliance-for-serviceoffering-related-credentials}

\textbf{Result}: \textit{Fail}
\\
\textbf{Comments}: \texttt{ServiceOffering}, \texttt{DataResource}, \texttt{SoftwareResource}, \texttt{InstantiatedVirtualResource}, and \texttt{ServiceAccessPoint} Gaia-X Credentials were created successfully, but the Gaia-X Compliance returned an error.
The exact response from Compliance can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:service_offering_compliance_response}.
The response indicates a user error, which the response body narrows down to the \texttt{exposedThrough} attribute of the \texttt{DataResource} Credential.

Upon examining the Gaia-X Registry, the database of the trusted credential shapes mandates the value to be a link to a Credential of type \texttt{ServiceOffering}.
However, the \texttt{DataResource} Credential created by the Carecentive backend links a credential of type \texttt{InstantiatedVirtualResource}, which is in line with the Gaia-X Trust Framework specifications~\cite{gaiax_trust_framework}.
The mismatch between documentation requirements and the formally implemented vocabulary is probably the reason for failure.

\section[Data Product Compliance]{Obtaining Gaia-X compliance for DataProduct-related Credentials}\label{sec:obtaining-gaia-x-compliance-for-dataproduct-related-credentials}

\textbf{Result}: \textit{Fail}
\\
\textbf{Comments}: \texttt{DataProductDescription}, \texttt{DatasetDescription}, and \texttt{DataUsage} Gaia-X Credentials were created successfully, but the Gaia-X Compliance returned an error.
The exact response from Compliance can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:data_product_compliance_response}.
The response indicates a user error, which the response body narrows down to a shape not being recognized by the Registry.
The error implies that the Gaia-X credentials defined by the Gaia-X ``\textit{Data Exchange specifications}''~\cite{gaiax_data_exchange_document} have not yet been implemented in the running GXDCH services.

\section{Exchange of questionnaire data}\label{sec:exchange-of-questionnaire-data}

\textbf{Result}: \textit{Pass}
\\
\textbf{Comments}: The data exchange contracting process is carried out successfully, resulting in a valid contract.
The contract is then used to successfully issue the access token, upon which the consumer successfully fetches the questionnaire data.

\section{Exchange of Withings data}\label{sec:exchange-of-withings-data}

\textbf{Result}: \textit{Pass}
\\
\textbf{Comments}: The data exchange contracting process is carried out successfully, resulting in a valid contract.
The contract is then used to successfully issue the access token, upon which the consumer successfully fetches the Withings data.

\section{Data exchange with policy negotiation}\label{sec:data-exchange-with-policy-negotiation}

\textbf{Result}: \textit{Unable to Conduct}
\\
\textbf{Reason}: \textit{Missing XFSC component}
\\
\textbf{Comments}: The experiment cannot be conducted because the ``\textit{Data Contracting Services}'' component is missing from the XFSC reference implementation.
The component is still under development but should provide policy negotiation and contracting services once it is finished.

\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

As previous sections showcase, the outcome of the experiments is the following.
