               implementations and applications in various industries. To this
               end, the book is structured in four parts: Part I ``Foundations
               and Contexts'' provides a general overview about building,
               running, and governing data spaces and an introduction to the
               IDS and GAIA-X projects. Part II ``Data Space Technologies''
               subsequently details various implementation aspects of IDS and
               GAIA-X, including eg data usage control, the usage of blockchain
               technologies, or semantic data integration and interoperability.
               Next, Part III describes various ``Use Cases and Data
               Ecosystems'' from various application areas such as agriculture,
               healthcare, industry, energy, and mobility. Part IV eventually
               offers an overview of several ``Solutions and Applications'', eg
               including products and experiences from companies like Google,
               SAP, Huawei, T-Systems, Innopay and many more. Overall, the book
               provides professionals in industry with an encompassing overview
               of the technological and economic aspects of data spaces, based
               on the International Data Spaces and Gaia-X initiatives. It
               presents implementations and business cases and gives an outlook

    abstract = "Background: Patient-centered health care information systems (PHSs) enable patients to take control and become knowledgeable about their own health, preferably in a secure environment. Current and emerging PHSs use either a centralized database, peer-to-peer (P2P) technology, or distributed ledger technology for PHS deployment. The evolving COVID-19 decentralized Bluetooth-based tracing systems are examples of disease-centric P2P PHSs. Although using P2P technology for the provision of PHSs can be flexible, scalable, resilient to a single point of failure, and inexpensive for patients, the use of health information on P2P networks poses major security issues as users must manage information security largely by themselves. Objective: This study aims to identify the inherent security issues for PHS deployment in P2P networks and how they can be overcome. In addition, this study reviews different P2P architectures and proposes a suitable architecture for P2P PHS deployment. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. We searched the following databases: IEEE Digital Library, PubMed, Science Direct, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and Semantic Scholar. The search was conducted on articles published between 2008 and 2020. The Common Vulnerability Scoring System was used as a guide for rating security issues. Results: Our findings are consolidated into 8 key security issues associated with PHS implementation and deployment on P2P networks and 7 factors promoting them. Moreover, we propose a suitable architecture for P2P PHSs and guidelines for the provision of PHSs while maintaining information security. Conclusions: Despite the clear advantages of P2P PHSs, the absence of centralized controls and inconsistent views of the network on some P2P systems have profound adverse impacts in terms of security. The security issues identified in this study need to be addressed to increase patients' intention to use PHSs on P2P networks by making them safe to use. ",

    ABSTRACT = {The May 2022 proposal from the European commission for a ‘European health data space’ envisages advantages for health from exploiting the growing mass of health data in Europe. However, key stakeholders have identified aspects that demand clarification to ensure success. Data will need to be freed from traditional silos to flow more easily and to cross artificial borders. Wide engagement will be necessary among healthcare professionals, researchers, and the patients and citizens that stand to gain the most but whose trust must be won if they are to allow use or transfer of their data. This paper aims to alert the wider scientific community to the impact the ongoing discussions among lawmakers will have. Based on the literature and the consensus findings of an expert multistakeholder panel organised by the European Alliance for Personalised Medicine (EAPM) in June 2022, it highlights the key issues at the intersection of science and policy, and the potential implications for health research for years, perhaps decades, to come.},

This access provides an unprecedented opportunity for data science technologies to derive data-driven insights and improve the quality of care delivery. Healthcare data, however, are usually fragmented and private making it difficult to generate robust results across populations. For example, different hospitals own the electronic health records (EHR) of different patient populations and these records are difficult to share across hospitals because of their sensitive nature. This creates a big barrier for developing effective analytical approaches that are generalizable, which need diverse, ``big data.'' Federated learning, a mechanism of training a shared global model with a central server while keeping all the sensitive data in local institutions where the data belong, provides great promise to connect the fragmented healthcare data sources with privacy-preservation. The goal of this survey is to provide a review for federated learning technologies, particularly within the biomedical space. In particular, we summarize the general solutions to the statistical challenges, system challenges, and privacy issues in federated learning, and point out the implications and potentials in healthcare.},

However, all these platforms are centralized and siloed which means that for large enterprise company they are growing to significant size and complexity level and becoming difficult to maintain and cost ineffective. To solve this problem, distributed data platform architecture and data mesh as the most widespread implementation of this architecture are proposed in this article. Firstly, analysis of siloed data platforms, their advancing features, implementation options and use cases are investigated. After that, analyzing reasons of large enterprises data platforms, characteristics of distributed data platform and data mesh are formed. Finally, data syndication and data quality process in data mesh platform architecture are identified as significant aspects of platform's adoption success and which require additional design, modeling and implementation research.",

    ABSTRACT = {Analytical data platforms have been used for decades to improve organizational performance. Starting from the data warehouses used primarily for structured data processing, through the data lakes oriented for raw data storage and post-hoc data analyses, to the data lakehouses—a combination of raw storage and business intelligence pre-processing for improving the platform’s efficacy. But in recent years, a new architecture called Data Mesh has emerged. The main promise of this architecture is to remove the barriers between operational and analytical teams in order to boost the overall value extraction from the big data. A number of attempts have been made to formalize and implement it in existing projects. Although being defined as a socio-technical paradigm, data mesh still lacks the technology support to enable its widespread adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new view of the platform requirements alongside the formal governance definition that we believe can help in the successful adoption of the data mesh. It is based on fundamental aspects such as decentralized data domains and federated computational governance. In addition, we also present a blockchain-based implementation of a mesh platform as a practical validation of our theoretical proposal. Overall, this article demonstrates a novel research direction for information system decentralization technologies.},
